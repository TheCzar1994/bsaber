review: '"One of the most well-known classical pieces finally gets a map worthy
  of its touchstone status. Cush captures the intense galloping energy of this
  piece with the tech increasing to huge movements in the top difficulty -
  enough to imagine oneself as a conductor, perhaps. (Note: Please do not
  conduct like this, you will most certainly hurt yourself and others in the
  process.)"'
