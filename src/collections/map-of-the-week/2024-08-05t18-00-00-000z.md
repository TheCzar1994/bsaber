review: "\"This is probably the most fun I've had playing a map in a while. The
  song is really goofy but if you can get past it, each of the diffs have their
  own strengths and ways to keep the map interesting with extremely satisfying
  tech in most of the diffs! Very well done!\" <i>- SC TheCzar1994</i>"
