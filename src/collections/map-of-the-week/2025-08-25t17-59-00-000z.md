review: "\"For Mozz_Zm's fourth map, all levels are really well polished and
  offer a great play. The use of all the different elements of map from notes,
  head notes, chains, walls, bombs etc. fit perfectly with the song without
  overdoing any of it. The Lawless E+ difficulty is creative genius. The use of
  noodle extensions adds to the whole experience rather than taking away from
  it. Great representation and deserves to be map of the week.\""
