<h1 style="text-align: center">Welcome to BEASTSABER! ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>

## Where to find Custom Songs

You'll find every single published map/song at your fingertips by going to [BeatSaver.com](https://beatsaver.com/). But, there are so many new maps released every day‚Ä¶ how do you know which ones to download? There are a few things to look for before you go wading through search results:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/uploads/sot-map-page.png">
</p>

- **[Curated Maps](https://beatsaver.com/?order=Curated&curated=true)**
  \
  These maps have been reviewed by one of our curators and deemed to have met a minimum quality standard. **Look for the green bar on the left side of the map card.** You may even see a featured review (surrounded by a green glow) in the Review tab on the map page.
- **Map Reviews**
  \
  Not all maps have reviews, but if they do, you'll find them in the "Reviews" tab. Map reviews allow players like you to share a little more commentary on why you liked (or didn‚Äôt like) a map than a simple upvote or downvote (and mappers love them!).
- **Follow the Mapper or the Curator**
  \
  Once you‚Äôve found some maps you really enjoy, look at who mapped or curated them, then click on their name to go to their profile page and check out their "Published" tab or "Curations" to find ALL of their maps in one place. To follow, simply click the blue "Follow" button just under their username on their profile page!

<br />

### BeatSaver Search Options

Some of the benefits of looking for songs on BeatSaver instead of in-game is a clearer look at curation, ratings, genres, difficulties, and more. There are several built-in search queries OR you can set your own filters!

<p align="center">
    <img src="/uploads/beatsaver-search-options.png">
</p>

**Dynamic search feeds include:**

- [**Curator Recommended**](https://beatsaver.com/?curated=true) ‚Äì All curated maps

- [**From Verified Mappers**](https://beatsaver.com/?verified=true) - All maps made by Verified Mappers

- [**Ranked Maps**](https://beatsaver.com/?ranked=true) ‚Äì A feed of ranked maps with award performance points (PP) toward ScoreSaber leaderboards

- **Top Maps of the Week** ‚Äì Maps with the most upvotes in a given week

- **Top Maps of the Month** - Maps with the most upvotes in a given month

- **Top Maps of the Year** - Maps with the most upvotes in a given year

- [**Newest Maps**](https://beatsaver.com/?order=Latest) - Every single map, except for AI-generated maps

You can also just use the site search in the top menu to find songs, artists, mappers, and more!

<br />

### Playlists and Map Packs

Playlists and map packs are a great way to find themed groupings of fantastic maps. From BeastSaber‚Äôs own Curators' Picks to curated packs for genres, artists, or albums; playlists allow you to easily use ModAssistant OneClick install to nab a bunch of quality songs all at once.

Take a look at the latest [Featured and Curated Packs](https://beatsaver.com/playlists?order=Curated). Featured Packs are reviewed by our team of Curators to be of minimum curation quality standards. You'll also find Packs for the Beasties, and other Curator Recommended packs! Want to learn more about Curation? [Click here!](/curation)

<br />

### The BeastSaber Home Page

The BeastSaber home page provides an excellent starting place to find recommended maps to download in an "easy on the eyes" appearance! Everything from Map of the Week, Featured Packs, Recently Curated Maps, and Recent Maps by Verified Mappers; we're sure you'll find something worth playing! These feeds are automatically pulled from BeatSaver.

<br />

### Still Can‚Äôt Find What You Want? Start Mapping!

Sometimes you‚Äôre looking for a specific song, artist, or genre and getting no results, or you get results but the maps are outside of your skill level. Take matters into your own hands and learn to map! Most mappers in the community got started for this very reason and there are a wealth of resources available to get you started.

## How to Install Custom Songs in Beat Saber

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure you have all Core Mods installed! When a new release is pushed from Beat Games, mods will usually break and will take some time to update. Be patient, and keep an eye in the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord Server](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) #modding-announcements channel to know when it's safe to update. **Don't have your mods installed yet? [Click here](/installing-the-mod-guide-necessary-for-any-custom-songs) to learn how to get and install custom mods!**

<br />

### Custom Songs for PCVR Users:

1. In [ModAssistant](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#mod-assistant), on the left-hand side, go to Options and click Enable OneClick Installs.

2. Select at least BeatSaver (though you may want the other options as well) and close ModAssistant.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/uploads/mod-assistant.png">
</p>

3. On [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/), find a song you want to download and click the OneClick Install button (the one that looks like a cloud with an arrow). You may see a confirmation box that your PC is trying to open ModAssistant.

4. The map will be downloaded, unzipped, and added to your CustomLevels folder.

**You're done!** You can now go in-game and play the map!

> üí° **Pro-Tip:** You can use OneClick with the game open! Follow the steps above and then go to your game window and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to refresh your songs and playlists!

<br />

<br />

### Custom Songs with the Base Game (No Mods):

If you don't want to install any mods, you can still play custom songs without them. Keep in mind, many maps recommend various mods and gameplay is usually better with mods.

1. On BeatSaver, find a song you want to download and click Download Zip. A zip file of the song you want will be saved to your computer.

2. Extract the zip file as a folder. It should already be titled with the map's "key" or the unique identifier for the map, and the song name and mapper(s) in parenthesis.

You can either extract in place and then cut/paste the folder into your CustomLevels folder, or you can select the path directly to your Custom Levels folder and extract it directly there.

> **Oculus User** folder paths tend to be: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
>
> **Steam User** folder paths tend to be: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`

<br />

## Custom Songs for Quest VR Users:

If you have your core Quest mods installed, adding songs and maps is extremely simple! Just open the game and look to the left where your mods are. You should have an option for "Song Downloader". Click on that and you'll find a search bar, as well as other filter options.

You can also manually install songs by downloading them from [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) and then using [ModsBeforeFriday (MBF)](https://mbf.bsquest.xyz/). Not familiar with MBF? [Read the Wiki here!](https://bsmg.wiki/quest/modding-with-mbf.html)
