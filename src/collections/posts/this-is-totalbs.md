> Before we begin, the BeastSaber Team would like to give a huge "THANK YOU" to everyone at TotalBS! In particular and most importantly **[Aeroluna](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284266)** who practically spearheaded the whole Extra Sensory II project and is a huge part of who the community can thank for the massive undertaking of EXSII, Vivify, and Synapse.\

# This is TotalBS!

Since the groundbreaking release of Noodle Extensions into the Custom Beat Saber Community in 2020, hundreds of high quality maps have pushed the limits on what you can do within the game to not only alter the environment, but the entire block slashing experience! [Take a look at the maps that shaped the initial release of Extra Sensory I here](/playlists/extra-sensory-i).

During the 2023 Beasties Awards Show, Mawntee, who is a member of the TotalBS team, unveiled a teaser of the work being done to create the latest groundbreaking event known as Extra Sensory II. Following this initial teaser, the team was hard at work to prepare for the final release - which saw incredible success and participation, so much so that they did an encore event the following week!
