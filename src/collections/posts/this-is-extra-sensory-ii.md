# This is Extra Sensory II

> Before we begin, the BeastSaber Team would like to give a huge "THANK YOU" to everyone at TotalBS! In particular and most importantly **[Aeroluna](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284266)** who practically spearheaded this whole project and is a huge part of who the community can thank for this massive undertaking.\
> \
> We'd also like to thank [Mawntee](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285959), [Swifter](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284246), and [TheGoodBoi](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284638) for their contributions to the project, as well as making these interviews about the project possible!

Since the groundbreaking release of Noodle Extensions into the Custom Beat Saber Community in about 2020, hundreds of high quality maps have pushed the limits on what you can do within the game and not only alter the environment, but the entire block slashing experience! [Take a look at the maps that shaped the initial release of Extra Sensory I here](/playlists/extra-sensory-i).

During the 2023 Beasties Awards Show, Mawntee, who is a member of the TotalBS team, unveiled a teaser of the work being done to create the latest groundbreaking mod known as Extra Sensory II. Following this teaser, we got a chance to talk with and interview several members of the TotalBS team to learn more about them and their passion with the Custom Beat Saber Community. In this multi-part interview, we will be sharing details about what it took to get to the release, as well as some sneak peaks into the development.

### Take a look at the trailer here!

<span class="notes">We probably want to update this to be the release video? Will need the video code/ID</span><!-- Update to newer trailer -->

After talking with the people over at TotalBS, I can tell you these people are genuinely ambitious about making the best experience possible for players of Beat Saber! It's been an absolute pleasure getting to hear their stories - but also to have the opportuinty to help present this to everyone for them!

## About the Sight-Read Event! <a href="#sight-read-event" style="text-decoration:none;">ðŸ”—</a> {$sight-read-event}

**Who can play:** Any PC Beat Saber player!
<br />
\*Currently, the Synapse Mod is only available on the PC version of Beat Saber. Remember, if you own the Oculus version, you can get a free PC version through the Oculus PC app and connect your headset!

**What is it:**

- Event will be a BR elimination style sight-read tournament, focused around maps with silly goofy gameplay gimmicks and visuals that haven't been seen before in Beat Saber
- The event is networked so that all players in the event lobby will be playing the same maps at the same time
- First map will be a freebie, nobody is getting eliminated
- For each following map, a chunk of players will be eliminated until the last map in the event will decide who the final winner is
- An eliminated player will still be able to participate in the event, their names will just be greyed out and their scores will be separated from the rest

**Where can I watch:**

**Where can I participate:**

**When:** December ??, 2024

## Let's Get To Some Questions!

<span class="notes">We could remove this if we want but I do think we could include some good info, particularly tutorial, or where people can go to get help, etc</span>

### Who is behind the TotalBS team?

As mentioned earlier, there are several community members on the TotalBS team, such as Aeroluna, Jevk, Mawntee, Pleast, Swifter, & TheGoodBoi; who were gracious enough to chat with us!

### Give us the history behind Extra Sensory I

### What exactly is Extra Sensory II? What are the functions or possibilities?

### What is the biggest difference between Extra Sensory I and II?

### Will there be a tutorial to help people learn how to use it?

### Where can we keep up with the latest on the project and the release date?
