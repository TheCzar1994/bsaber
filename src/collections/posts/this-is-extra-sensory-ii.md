# This is Extra Sensory II

> Before we begin, the BeastSaber Team would like to give a huge "THANK YOU" to everyone at TotalBS! In particular and most importantly **[Aeroluna](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284266)** who practically spearheaded this whole project and is a huge part of who the community can thank for this massive undertaking.\

> We'd also like to thank [Jevk](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284636), [Mawntee](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285959), [Pleast](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285189), [Swifter](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284246), and [TheGoodBoi](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284638) for their contributions to the project, as well as making these interviews about the project possible!

Since the groundbreaking release of Noodle Extensions into the Custom Beat Saber Community, hundreds of high quality maps have pushed the limits on what you can do within the game and not only alter the environment, but the entire block slashing experience!

During the 2023 Beasties Awards Show, Mawntee, who is a member of the TotalBS team, unveiled a teaser of the work being done to create the latest groundbreaking mod known as Extra Sensory II. Following this teaser, we got a chance to talk with and interview several members of the TotalBS team to learn more about them and their passion with the Custom Beat Saber Community. In this multi-part interview, we will be sharing details about what it took to get to the release, as well as some sneak peaks into the development.
