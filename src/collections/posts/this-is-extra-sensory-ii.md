# This is Extra Sensory II

Since the groundbreaking release of Noodle Extensions into the Custom Beat Saber Community in 2020, hundreds of high quality maps have pushed the limits on what you can do within the game to not only alter the environment, but the entire block slashing experience! [Take a look at the maps that shaped the initial release of Extra Sensory I here](/playlists/extra-sensory-i).

During the 2023 Beasties Awards Show, Mawntee, who is a member of the TotalBS team, unveiled a teaser of the work being done to create the latest groundbreaking event known as Extra Sensory II. Following this initial teaser, the team has been hard at work to prepare for the final release - and we're just about there!

This time, EXSII will feature a truly interactive live event, enabled by Synapse, a cutting-edge mod that brings players from around the world together to engage with innovative new maps in real-time. Participants will compete against each other on a shared leaderboard and can communicate seamlessly using the in-game chat feature.
