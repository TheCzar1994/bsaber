# This is Extra Sensory II

> Before we begin, the BeastSaber Team would like to give a huge "THANK YOU" to everyone at TotalBS! In particular and most importantly **[Aeroluna](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284266)** who practically spearheaded this whole project and is a huge part of who the community can thank for this massive undertaking.\
> \
> We'd also like to thank [Jevk](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284636), [Mawntee](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285959), [Pleast](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285189), [Swifter](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284246), and [TheGoodBoi](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4284638) for their contributions to the project, as well as making these interviews about the project possible!

Since the groundbreaking release of Noodle Extensions into the Custom Beat Saber Community in about 2020, hundreds of high quality maps have pushed the limits on what you can do within the game and not only alter the environment, but the entire block slashing experience! [Take a look at the maps that shaped the initial release of Extra Sensory I here](/playlists/extra-sensory-i).

During the 2023 Beasties Awards Show, Mawntee, who is a member of the TotalBS team, unveiled a teaser of the work being done to create the latest groundbreaking mod known as Extra Sensory II. Following this teaser, we got a chance to talk with and interview several members of the TotalBS team to learn more about them and their passion with the Custom Beat Saber Community. In this multi-part interview, we will be sharing details about what it took to get to the release, as well as some sneak peaks into the development.

### Take a look at the trailer here!

<span class="notes">We probably want to update this to be the release video? Will need the video code/ID</span><!-- Update to newer trailer -->

After talking with the people over at TotalBS, I can tell you these people are genuinely ambitious about making the best experience possible for players of Beat Saber! It's been an absolute pleasure getting to hear their stories - but also to have the opportuinty to help present this to everyone for them!
