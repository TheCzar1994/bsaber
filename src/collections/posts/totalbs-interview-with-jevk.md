# Interview with Jevk

## Jevk is a member of TotalBS, and a Verified Mapper with 54 maps published as of writing this article. They're also from Finland!

You might've heard of Jevk around the community; especially more recently as the Mappers' Choice & Community Choice Winner of Best Modchart in the 2023 BeastSaber Mapping Awards. You can see their award-winning map ["Camellia - GHOUL"](https://beatsaver.com/maps/31809) here:

### Q: Tell us who you are! Your name, how long youâ€™ve been playing Beat Saber, what got you started playing, what got you started modding, hobbies, etc.

**A:** Hi! I'm Jevk, a Beat Saber player and mapper from Finland. I've been playing Beat Saber for about 5 years at this point. My first look at the game was in Assembly Summer 2018, a gaming/demoscene convention in Finland, just looked at someone playing it at the "VR Corner" and didn't think much of it.

Later that year, I was watching my at the time favorite streamer, BTMC, and I saw him playing it and thought that it looked cool. So essentially osu! got me into the game. I started saving for my first VR headset, it took me about a year but eventually, I bought the OG Vive set and on the same day, I bought Beat Saber as my first VR game. I remember not even opening the game before I already googled how to get custom songs. :D

I think what really got me interested in the game is the fact that I had always wanted a VR headset ever since I saw PewDiePie try the original Oculus dev kit. And I've always been keen on rhythm games as well, so it was a combination of both. I also play the piano and studied music theory for a bit which probably also got my interest in rhythm games. 

<br />

### Q: Where else do you participate in the Custom Beat Saber Community? Mapping? Ranking? How long?

**A:** I've been a mapper for as long as I can remember. I think I made my first map the same Summer I bought my Vive. It was never published, though because it was a bad map. But I think my interest in Beat Saber mapping also came from "osu!" mapping. I had made a few "osu! maps before getting into Beat Saber as well so I think that's also something that really affected what I'm doing today.

<br />

### Q: When and why did you start coding?

**A:** I think my coding interest started when I was very young, I think I was experimenting with batch scripts already at the age of 8 or 9. And my parents noticed my interest in computers so one day, my mom bought me a book about the Python programming language and I think that's when I started really programming. Of course, the 10-year-old me making Python scripts isn't anything particularly BIG, but it was a start for my coding interest really. Ironically though, I really hate the Python programming language nowadays, while a friend of mine is a cult follower of it.

<br />

### Q: What mod(s), websites, tools, etc. have you made or contributed to for the Beat Saber community? (If any)

**A:** I've made a tool for mod-charting called HeckLib, mostly because I was too stubborn to learn Swifter's ReMapper. So I made my own tool with a different syntax that feels more readable and usable to me. Many people have thought that Swifter and I hated each other and competed with each other with these tools when in reality I feel like we're just friends.

> HeckLib is a TypeScript library for making mod-charts for Beat Saber using the Heck mods. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Heck-Library/HeckLib)

Generally, the biggest difference between ReMapper and HeckLib is that ReMapper is designed for making visual maps, and HeckLib is designed for mod-charting. Both can be used for both purposes, but I built HeckLib specifically for my usage. A huge difference in the backend of ReMapper also is that instead of being built with Node.JS, like HeckLib, it uses Deno. Deno is just something that didn't work for me so I wanted to keep it with Node.JS, I could yap about this for ages but I'm just gonna keep it short like this.

<br />

### Q: For you, what was the most interesting or exciting part behind Extra Sensory I (Noodle Extensions)? What is your favorite Noodle Extensions map? (Feel free to include your own if you have one and someone else's if you want)

**A:** I didn't really participate in Extra Sensory much, but I remember playing the maps when they came out and I instantly fell in love with how you can use gimmicks as such to create an additional challenge to the map. And I remember grinding all of the maps even after ES ended. Ever since that, I tried to figure out how to make mod-charts myself, because I didn't see many more come out after Extra Sensory.

<br />

### Q: What was your role in Extra Sensory II? Give us a deeper dive into how you became involved, the commitment to keeping progress moving, were there any struggles? (Can also focus on the good qualities of the process instead of struggles. Were there any huge accomplishments where everyone worked together?)

**A:** I think I was invited to TotalBS after I showed Mawntee [my first mod-chart](https://beatsaver.com/maps/14171) and a [light show](https://beatsaver.com/maps/14500) I made shortly after.

How the idea of Extra Sensory II started is beyond me, but I remember trying to start the NESRT (Noodle Extensions Sight-Reading Tournament) with my good friend, Emerald. Which is when I think either Mawntee or Reaxt told me that this could be somehow implemented with the release of Vivify and I was told not to do the tournament after that.

I had multiple scrapped maps in my WIP folder experimenting with the mod and a few of them were a collaboration with the Hungarian mod-chart mapper, Sands. These maps will never see the light of day because I accidentally made a Unity script that deleted all of them.

Now, apparently, Vivify has been in the works before I even made my first mod-chart. So, it's been a project for a good while now. There were many deadlines that we were given, so I really didn't think this would ever release but well, here we are now!

<br />

### Q: What was the most challenging part of getting this together?

**A:** I don't know about the others but for me, the toughest part was to not get any external feedback, because of course, I couldn't tell about this to anyone until now.

<br />

### Q: For someone who doesn't know anything about coding, where and how do you recommend they get started? Do you have any role models in the community?

**A:** If you really want to learn how to write code, a great resource is [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) they have free programming language learning courses for everyone. That's where I usually direct people when they want to learn their first programming language.

If you already know how to write code, great! I recommend going to the Heck Wiki to learn how Noodle and Chroma actually work and then picking up a script or a framework to work with. My recommendations are Swifter's ReMapper (for visual mapping) and HeckLib (for gimmick mapping). Personally, I learned from Mawntee because Mawntee kinda taught me how to do everything with a script as soon as I joined TotalBS, but I don't think he'd do that to everyone who just asks (might be wrong though). I'm also open to teaching anyone who's willing to jump in a call with me.

<br />

### Q: Is there anything else you'd like to share in general?

**A:** It's been very demotivating seeing how people see a mod-chart and instantly assume "Nah, I can't do it" after the mapper spends months on making it and tweaking it to make it more playable.

Modcharts are not designed to be SS'd first try. Please try a bit more.
