Featured Packs (or playlists) are a great way to find a collection of quality maps that go together cohesively to match a specific theme. This can make it easier to quickly download several fun maps all at once instead of trying to find specific maps to download.

You can see a collection of featured playlists [here](/playlists/page/1)! Playlists with a gold glowing border indicate a pack featured directly on BeastSaber with a customized page!

## What is a Featured Pack?

A featured pack is a collection of maps that fit a clear theme. For example, there could be genre related packs (rock, hip-hop, dance, etc.), artist/album/record label packs (packs based around a certain artist or record label, or packs that include songs from a certain album), or event packs (playlists that were uploaded as part of an event hosted by organizations such as BSMG. Unlike other featured playlists, the quality of the maps in event packs does not make a difference). The title and description of each pack must make it clear what the theme of the playlist is.

<br />

## What are the requirements? <a href="#requirements" style="text-decoration:none;">ðŸ”—</a> {id$requirements}

- Packs must have at least 5 maps that total a minimum of 40 points to be featured. You can use the [pack calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14DLNfVh5BOFrh1Ja6fuLMAfZKXRlLQ8xFwzSXZe_Zt4/edit?usp=sharing) to estimate your points.

- Each playlist must have a clear theme.

- At least 75% of the maps in a pack need to have been made for the pack, even if they were released over time. Adding a bunch of old maps that happen to fit the theme to hit the point threshold is uncool. 6 months is usually the cutoff point at which we consider maps "old" and not made for the pack.

- All maps in the pack should be free of objective errors, but we know it doesn't always work out that way. Small packs should be entirely free of objective errors, but that is exponentially harder for big packs. So, depending on the pack size, we can allow you some outliers.
  
  This is the solution we have come up with:

  | Number of maps in the pack | Number of outliers allowed |
  | -------------- | -------------- |
  | 5 or 6 | 0 |
  | 7, 8, or 9 | 1 |
  | 10, 11, or 12 | 2 |
  | 13, 14, or 15 | 3 |
  | 16+ | 25% of the total |

## How do I get my pack featured?

You'll need to be in the [**BeastSaber Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5VaEjFeuny) and head to the [ðŸ’¬ featured-pack-request](https://discord.com/channels/452928402203344908/1054923661267705917) thread channel. From there, you'll see a "How to request a pack and what rules to follow" thread pinned at the top with all of the latest requirements (this post may eventually become outdated). That thread will contain a post format that you can use to start a post.

You'll also need to:
  - Attach 1280 x 1280 pack image, if available
  - Post your published map links and the finished playlist link as separate messages (without embeds) in the post **at least 48 hours before the date you'd like the pack to be featured on BeastSaber**. That gives our curation team time to vet the pack before its featured. Note that we will only guarantee each of your maps to be checked once, so make sure they are up to standard before submitting them. Curators may still check a map again after it was fixed, but that is out of their own goodwill, so don't rely on that.
  - Check the [Pack Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFjgmFBHBaFO47isEOor7MVqY_l-qfWnUeEZzHuDD90/edit?usp=sharing) to determine what date you want your playlist featured. Make sure you choose a date that has an available slot. We do our best to spread out packs, especially those from frequent pack-makers so that we have something new being featured each week. Packs can be "released" on BeatSaver any week but they won't be featured until their scheduled date.

## Some things to note

- If you are an eligible [Patreon supporter](https://www.patreon.com/BeastSaberNews) and want to have a fancy custom bsaber playlist page [like this](/playlists/eminem-pack), be sure to note that in your pack request and/or reach out to @TheCzar1994 on Discord in advance.

- Pack featuring, just like curation, is a privilege, not a right. Even if all requirements are met, it does not guarantee that it will be featured.

- Senior Curators have the final say and may refuse a pack for reasons such as but not limited to theming, quality, or bad behavior; but if it fulfills all requirements, it will most likely get featured.

## Rules for Updating an Existing Pack <a href="#updating-packs" style="text-decoration:none;">ðŸ”—</a> {id$updating-packs}

This is for mappers that are making follow up packs/"Volume 2s" to their previously featured Playlists. We are allowing the option to update the original pack and have the pack re-featured with the new content. The update request will work the same as normal playlist requests. You will fill out a request the same way and link the pack you are updating.

1. The Pack being updated must have been featured/vetted in the past by the Curation Team
  
    If this is not the case, treat your pack as a new playlist request and refer to regular playlist request rules. 

2. Pack updates must still follow normal playlist request rules

    Stick to your original packs clear theme. No twisting or bending your theme to force enough points to be an update.

3. Point system is the same. Only count the points of new maps being added

    Treat your update as a new pack, which in the final stages is to be combined with the original. The points must reach the minimum set value for featuring a pack without the help from maps in the original pack. The number of allowed outliers is also only determined by the new maps.

4. The maps being requested must be newer than the packs last featuring date

    Maps being added are an update and should reflect that. Remaps/Remasters of maps that already exist in the pack being updated can be added but wont count towards the points required for featuring. 

5. Time Restrictions

    You must also wait at least 6 months between featuring. This is so the pack doesn't stay on the front page month after month. 

6. Change the Cover Art
 
    Do some cosmetic changes to the pack (cover art as a minimum). Make it feel new and exciting as it returns to the front page!
