# Getting Started with Mapping Levels - A Guide

## Too many anime maps? Not enough anime maps? Take matters into your own hands and make one!

There are more than 100,000 maps on [BeatSaver.com](https://beatsaver.com) but you still may not be able to find the song you want, or you find the song you want but it only has an ExpertPlus difficulty that is out of your reach. **_Anyone_** can learn to make their own maps with the resources available on this page!

Although the BeastSaber team is mostly focused on things like curation, map reviews, and other news, the following will give you a head-start on your mapping adventure!

<br />

## [BSMG Mapping Quick Start](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/)

1. Download the necessary tools for mapping: an [audio editor](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and a [map editor](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#map-editing-resources).
2. [Set up your audio file](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#audio-editing-resources), find and confirm the BPM, and export in OGG format.
3. Set up your song in your [mapping editor](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#map-editing-resources) (steps vary by editor).
4. Get mapping! Review [basic mapping practices](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/basic-mapping.html) before you start. [Playtest](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#playtesting) your own work early and often while mapping.
5. Get lighting! Review [basic lighting information](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#lighting-practices). Simple manual lighting is easier than you think!
6. Get your map [playtested](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#playtesting)! Third-party playtesting via the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) is highly recommended to get constructive feedback and to get past your own "map blindness."
7. Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested you're ready to [release](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#publishing-songs) your song to the world on BeatSaver.

## BSMG Mapping Wiki

The [BSMG Mapping Wiki](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/) launched in December 2019 and combined information from more than 30 different separate guides to become the holy grail of mapping knowledge.

For those who are new to mapping and just finding their way, or those who are “mapping-curious” and are looking for how to get started, the wiki has it all including a [glossary](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/glossary.html) of mapping terms, helpful [quick starts](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#mapping-quick-start) (like the one above), basic/intermediate/advanced level information on [audio setup](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#audio-editing-resources), [mapping](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#mapping-practices), and the critical steps of [playtesting](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#playtesting) and [releasing](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#publishing-songs) your map.

## Real-Time Mapping Support & Socials

Even after reviewing available text and video resources, some people still want or need some extra support. Other people want to meet and network with other mappers to pick up even more tips and strategies.

### [Beat Saber Modding Group (BSMG) Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)

The BSMG Discord is one of the largest servers in existence with more than 250,000 users! It has #mapping-discussion and #testplays channels dedicated to mapping and a (mostly on-topic) group of enthusiastic mappers ready to help you whip those maps into shape or troubleshoot issues. They also have a great #community-hub channel so you can socialize even more based on your taste and preference!

### [Beat Saber Mapping Discord](https://discord.gg/ArT4BTQ)

Once you have your very own first map created and released you can request a role in the Mapping Discord. Here you’ll be able to go into a lot more detail on the various aspects of mapping, lighting, modded maps, chroma, and much more. This server also has a healthy social and voice chat scene for mappers.
