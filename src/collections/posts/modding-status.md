## üéâ  Beat Saber 1.36.0 Has Released üéâ

This update features the Hip Hop Mixtape Pack and various fixes. The Hip Hop Mixtape is the very first release with uncensored tracks. There is a new option in settings called, ‚ÄúExplicit Lyrics Toggle‚Äù to control whether you see these maps or not. Read more about this update in the [Release Notes]

### PC Modding | ‚ùå

**1.35.0 mods are NOT compatible with this update.**
\
‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to backup your custom data such as maps, models, configs, etc. by copying the folders to another location before updating/downgrading.
\
Press the Uninstall BSIPA button in Mod Assistant settings to get an unmodded game and to make sure you don't break your game with broken mods.

Want to downgrade?
