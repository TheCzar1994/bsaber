### PC Modding | ‚ùå

1.35.0 mods are **NOT** compatible with this update.

<br />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to backup your custom data such as maps, models, configs, etc. by copying the folders to another location before updating/downgrading.

<br />

<br />

Press the Uninstall BSIPA button in Mod Assistant settings to get an unmodded game and to make sure you don't break your game with broken mods.

<br />

### Want to downgrade?

- Visit the [downgrading page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#downgrading) on the wiki

- Use the legacy branch for `1.29.1` or whichever version you wish to downgrade to.

### Quest Modding | ‚ùå

It is currently **NOT** safe to update if you want custom songs or mods! Please stay on your current version of Beat Saber and check later for further updates.

<br />

### Want to downgrade?

At this time, we recommend using MBF instead of BMBF for both downgrade and modding help.

### ‚ùì Need Help?

If you run into issues or need additional help with the modding process, just ask in the [BSMG](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) #‚Å†pc-help or #‚Å†quest-help channels depending on your game platform! Note that help is on a volunteer basis so please be patient and do not ask modding questions in other server channels.
