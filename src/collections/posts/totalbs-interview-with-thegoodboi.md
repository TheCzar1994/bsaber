### Q: Tell us who you are! Your name, how long you’ve been playing Beat Saber, what got you started playing, what got you started modding, hobbies, etc.

**A:** Hiii!!! I'm TheGoodBoi, or GoodBoi for short, but my real-life name is Drew. I live near the West Coast of the US; so if I ever take too long to respond to your messages, I'm probably just a few hours behind you.

In late 2018 I saw PewDiePie play some custom songs in this virtual reality game called Beat Saber, and I was instantly hooked. I first played the game on Christmas of that year, when my little brother and I got a VR headset as a gift. Being 11 years old at the time and not even at a healthy age to be using VR, had no idea how computers even worked let alone how to mod the game.

It wasn't until summer of 2019 that I figured out how to install mods and custom songs. I genuinely believe that finally figuring it out and being able to play [Believer](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1fef) mapped by Rustic for the first time was one of the happiest moments in my life lol.

Also, if you'd like to ask about pets, I have a dog. She's cute. No, I will not e*LAB*orate.

### Q: Where else do you participate in the Custom Beat Saber Community? Mapping? Ranking? How long?

**A:** Honestly, I'd say that mapping is the only part of the community I actually participate in. I don't mod, rank, curate, support, commission, review, develop, organize, staff, or even really talk in servers all that much anymore. I obviously want to change that, but I'm abysmal at starting conversations. (Please @ me I'm desperate)

<br />

### Q: When and why did you start coding?

**A:** I first used the block coding website Scratch during fourth grade in early 2017, played around in Roblox Studio in mid-2020, but only seriously decided to learn to code in late 2021.

I got into JavaScript specifically to make a better Noodle Extension map than the "incident" involving that song about the two vertical directions. I learned a lot to make The Glorious Octagon of Destiny, and it's essentially what got me into actually coding.

Since then I've slowly kept improving. The minimal programming skills I gained from map-making have expanded into a few other practical parts of my life, and it's been pretty useful at times!

<br />

### Q: What mod(s), websites, tools, etc. have you made or contributed to for the Beat Saber community? (If any)

**A:** Not much, unfortunately. Back in 2019 I helped with the BSMG Wiki a little, and I have a GitHub repo with some JS and RM functions I've used in NE maps, but that's about it.

<br />

### Q: For you, what was the most interesting or exciting part behind Extra Sensory I (Noodle Extensions)? What is your favorite Noodle Extensions map?

**A:** Since I didn't participate in EXSI (Extra Sensory I), I was really just astounded at the possibilities the maps presented. Everything about them was super cool, and while I never thought I would have ever been able to create anything like them at the time, I still felt a rush of inspiration and opportunity.

Choosing a favorite Noodle map is hard, but I'd have to go for Mawntee's map: [DJ TECHNORCH - Love Love Love You I Love You (Eye's by Eyes Remix)](https://beatsaver.com/maps/133c5). The effects and note mods are insane and have personally been the most visually pleasing and fun to play. [Capone - Oh No (instrumental)](https://beatsaver.com/maps/108ee) also by Mawntee is a close second though. Creative idea, fantastically executed, and super hilarious.

<br />

### Q: What was your role in Extra Sensory II? Give us a deeper dive into how you became involved, the commitment of keeping progress moving, were there any struggles? (Can also focus on the good qualities of the process instead of struggles. Were there any huge accomplishments where everyone worked together?)

**A:** I made two maps for the event, one of which was used in the teaser, which is sick. I guess you could say the maps introduced and revealed quite a few bugs to fix, helping a bit with development. I also tested and gave feedback on several maps made by others, and I even made the EXSII banner logo used for the event:

</p>

I got involved in EXSII because I was doing Vivify stuff and sharing it with TotalBS (TBS), a group that I got roped into after my first NE map made its rounds in the community. A fun fact about when I first got into the secret TBS club is that there was a double-secret TBS club, the place where the first talks of a sight-read tournament were happening. Eventually getting into double-secret status felt like finding out your friend group had a separate and more active group chat with everyone except you. Good thing this hierarchy doesn't exist anymore! At least I think so, perhaps there's a triple-secret I don't know about, hmm…

When making my maps for EXSII, I tried to keep up with HR/Mawntee's soft deadlines the best I could, but I think the hardest part was getting everyone else involved to do the same. What really got people moving though was basically the announcement of "Alright guys we're making the trailer" which I found to be pretty funny.

A huge positive part of the process though was getting to share work-in-progress stuff and then getting a wave of compliments and feedback about your silly ideas. The Breezer map I made for the event was originally intended as a small side project to put together a joke I had a while before making it. After sharing a video of the map with the group, the concept was liked so much that it was chosen to be the teaser and first map in EXSII. With the help of other members, it was developed to be an actual mod chart with a neat gameplay gimmick, something that would've never happened without the exciting back-and-forths with TBS.

<br />

### Q: What was the most challenging part of getting this together?

**A:** For me, it was making the maps while Vivify was being developed. There were multiple times I had to reinstall Beat Saber, change my Unity project file's version, fix prefabs, swap out plugins, update my shaders, etc. It got incredibly tedious at times. Thankfully, Aeroluna and several other TBS members were very willing to help out with any issues and confusion I had.

<br />

### Q: For someone who doesn't know anything about coding, where and how do you recommend they get started? Do you have any role models in the community?

**A:** I mean hey, if you wanna do what I did, go ahead and watch [freeCodeCamp.org's 3-hour JavaScript course](https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg) on YouTube. That got me most of the way there for coding!

I definitely have to highlight [Mawntee](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4285959) as a role model, with all the meme songs and note-mod-focused maps he's made, I can only dream of being as talented as he is lol.

<br />

### Q: Is there anything else you’d like to share about the project?

**A:** About the project specifically? No, but… Participating in this event got me to learn the basics of a bunch of different things related to digital art. These mainly being Blender, 3D modeling and simulations, Unity, and shaders. Shaders are definitely the most fun and interesting to me out of these and have actually given me a real-world use for stuff like trigonometry and matrices I've learned about in school, which I think is super sweet.

<br />

### Q: Is there anything else you'd like to share in general?

**A:** My birthday is April 11th. You've got about a year to prepare.

:D
