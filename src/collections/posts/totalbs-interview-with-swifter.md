# Interview with Swifter

## Swifter is a member of TotalBS, and a Verified Mapper with 56 maps published as of writing this article. They're also from Canada!

Surely you've heard of Swifter!? You know... one of the mappers involved in the (as of writing this article) #2 map of all time with a whopping 16,000 upvotes: [{Modchart} acloudyskye - Somewhere Out There](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1e6ff). This map won in the 2021 BeastSaber Mapping Awards for not only the Best ModChart of the Year, but also *THE* Map of the Year!

### Q: Tell us who you are! Your name, how long you’ve been playing Beat Saber, what got you started playing, what got you started modding, hobbies, etc.

**A:** I'm Swifter! I've been doing stuff in Beat Saber for about 5 years or so now. I'm known for my visual art that I make in the game, mostly by the infamous "Somewhere Out There" map that blew up around 2 years ago. But I've done more since and have a lot of passion for making beautiful audio-visual-physical experiences.

### Q: Where else do you participate in the Custom Beat Saber Community? Mapping? Ranking? How long?

**A:** I'm generally in my little corner of the community making my maps and posting them occasionally. I think a lot of people know me/see me around so in some ways I am connected to the whole community, but I rarely check servers or anything.

### Q: When and why did you start coding?

**A:** You could say I started "scripting" around 2015 with the Minecraft command system; I actually used to be a mapmaker for Minecraft Realms and a few YouTubers like PrestonPlayz. A lot of the same logic of those systems still applies to actual languages, but Minecraft's systems were a lot more limiting and verbose. I was scared of "real coding" for a while, but finally, the ice was broken in late 2019 by my computer science teacher, and I thank him so much for that. Ever since then, I've learned Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, GLSL, and HLSL.

The reason is definitely on a case-by-case basis, but the main draw for me is it's just really fun, in the same sort of way as solving a puzzle. Sometimes I'll be doing it for art reasons, other times for practical reasons like calculating the cost of something or doing homework for me.

### Q: What mod(s), websites, tools, etc. have you made or contributed to for the Beat Saber community? (If any)

**A:** I have made a couple of tools for the community, most notably [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper). ReMapper was "founded" by me and [Fern](https://github.com/Fernthedev), a creator who ports most of Aeroluna's mods to the quest version of the game. I wanted to make the technology I developed from making Somewhere Out There more abstracted and accessible, while Fern wanted to guarantee proper syntax in maps to avoid silly mistakes from mappers. It was really the perfect project; Fern is sort of a professional so he basically took on the role of guiding the project and mentoring me. Believe it or not, ReMapper also counted toward credits that enabled me to graduate high school. Lots of popular maps in the community are made using ReMapper or some adaptation of the code from it, which is really fantastic!

Another smaller thing I made was [Enlighten](https://github.com/Swifter1243/Enlighten), which is just a plugin for ChroMapper that helps create advanced lighting patterns. It allows you to do things like hue shift lighting events, generate gradients, generate pulse effects, and much more!

I'm also working on some tools to lower the barrier to entry for the new mod. I'm preparing a Unity project that will export for all versions of the game necessary, and it provides a bunch of scenes with shader examples. ReMapper will also work with this new mod at launch with some really neat integration with the Unity project. It will allow you to have information about all of your assets while you're typing the code!

### Q: For you, what was the most interesting or exciting part behind Extra Sensory I (Noodle Extensions)? What is your favorite Noodle Extensions map? (Feel free to include your own if you have one and someone else's if you want)

**A:** I only vaguely remember Extra Sensory from the outside, as I joined TotalBS a while after it launched. But it definitely set the foundation for things to come. Ironically, I found Chroma ended up really being the mod to carry things forward. All of the crazy environment maps you see are actually 95% carried by Chroma; it's a common misconception that Noodle is a powerhouse for visuals.

As far as favorite maps that include Noodle Extensions go, I have to say Somewhere Out There since that one obviously means a ton to me. But I would say Noodle Extensions mostly represents gameplay gimmicks, in which case I'd have to go with [Love Love Love](https://beatsaver.com/maps/133c5) by Mawntee since I have the most fond memories of that one being absolutely insane.

### Q: What was your role in Extra Sensory II? Give us a deeper dive into how you became involved, the commitment to keeping progress moving, were there any struggles? (Can also focus on the good qualities of the process instead of struggles. Were there any huge accomplishments where everyone worked together?)

**A:** I feel like I have slowly been becoming more and more of a leader in the project; trying to get things moving along and volunteering to get things done that need to get done. As I mentioned before, I've been trying my best to make tools for everyone, but I've also been doing my best at just motivating people.

### Q: What was the most challenging part of getting this together?

**A:** The hardest thing about Extra Sensory II was going from moving around existing game assets with Chroma/Noodle Extensions to diving head-first into 3D art. For me, I was dead set on learning how to make EVERYTHING by myself. I don't find it fulfilling to spend my time searching for things that exist already (to an extent!) when I could have way more fun spending that time making it myself. That being said, we all had a long road to getting a better understanding of computer science, art, and programming.

### Q: For someone who doesn't know anything about coding, where and how do you recommend they get started? Do you have any role models in the community?

**A:** This is a bit of a tough one because there's no one-size-fits-all. For me what worked was just taking on challenges as they came, and being passionate/interested. Watching videos and slowly absorbing information, while asking people questions and pursuing results. Honestly just throwing yourself into the water and learning to swim is your best bet. Also, programming is NOT as difficult as people make it out to be. Seriously, a third-grader could learn to program. It's entirely about the complexity of the problem you're trying to solve. It also depends on the experience you have breaking it down into smaller chunks while also having an intuition of forward thinking and being able to see the big picture of the problem.

A big issue I see for a lot of first-time programmers is that they are thinking about how to do a large task, but they just aren't able to logic out how that task is composed. I think it is important to start out doing small coding challenges, either self-imposed or through websites that provide them to you. This will help you understand how to solve problems.

### Q: Is there anything else you’d like to share about the project?

**A:** I want to tell you that the lid is about to be blown wide open when it comes to Beat Saber content, and possibly VR content as a whole. Having a platform to bring together music, movement, and visuals like this is something truly unique and has not really been pushed to this extent before. If you think the maps that are out there right now are impressive, you've seen nothing. I also hope that this allows people to get into 3D art/content creation because it is truly something special. Making this event into what it is has been one of the most fulfilling things we've ever achieved!

### Q: Is there anything else you'd like to share in general?

**A:** Just as far as my own personal art goes, I still have a lot to say and a lot to make. I can't help but feel a self-imposed sense of guilt that I haven't made anything "big" in quite some time (I'm sure LOTS of artists can resonate with this). The last "big" multi-environment and incredibly ambitious chart I made was [Heliov](https://beatsaver.com/maps/27ade), about 2 years ago now (that feels insane but anyway). What I've made for EXSII definitely feels like another one of those to me, but also not the most ambitious I could get or the best I can do. I can't wait to make something that truly displays my fiery ambition. I want to blow everyone away. I really hope I can put something like that together, it's a constant struggle, but I'm slowly building up to it.

For any artists who feel this way, like they're constantly chasing the next best thing, please remember that that's the reason we're all still creating. If you ever "peaked", and felt like you truly couldn't do anything better, then what would you even do at that point? You'd probably feel similar to finishing an amazing game or TV series. The beauty is we will never reach that point. Realistically I'm gonna make whatever I want to make and then I'll immediately be dreaming up whatever comes next.

But guess what, I'll do that until the day I die. I'm really excited to see how far things can be pushed :)
