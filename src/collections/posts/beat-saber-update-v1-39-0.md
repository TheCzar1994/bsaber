# Wondering if you should update?

Yes! It is recommended to update to 1.39+ as most mods are now available. Scores on past or "legacy" versions will likely no longer be supported. This might mean that if you play on 1.29.1, for example, you will not be able to submit scores via mods like ScoreSaber and BeatLeader if/when the change happens.
