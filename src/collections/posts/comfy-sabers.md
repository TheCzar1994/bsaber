<b>Event Name:</b> Comfy Sabers - Season 3
<br />
<b>Event Type:</b> Tournament
<br />
<b>Start Date:</b> April 24, 2024
<br />
<b>End Date:</b> June 16, 2024
<br />
<b>About this Event:</b><p>This tournament was created to allow players that normally wouldn't be able to participate in Beat Saber tournaments such as World Cup to experience the thrill of participating in a tournament. As such, any players who are better than rank 2000 on ScoreSaber are not allowed to participate; anyone above can play the qualifiers in order to participate in the tournament.</p>
<p>There will be two divisions, a lower and a higher division, to allow for a more equal playing field. The qualifier deadline is Sunday, the 12th of May.</p>
