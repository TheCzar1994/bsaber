**Event Name:** Comfy Sabers - Season 3
\
**Event Type:** Tournament
\
**Start Date:** April 24, 2024
\
**End Date:** June 16, 2024
\
**About this Event:** This tournament was created to allow players that normally wouldn't be able to participate in Beat Saber tournaments such as World Cup to experience the thrill of participating in a tournament. As such, any players who are better than rank 2000 on ScoreSaber are not allowed to participate; anyone above can play the qualifiers in order to participate in the tournament.
\
There will be two divisions, a lower and a higher division, to allow for a more equal playing field. The qualifier deadline is Sunday, the 12th of May.
